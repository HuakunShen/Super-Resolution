# Dataset Setup

We used 2 Datasets

- DIV2K
- TEXT

We made some modifications to the Original Datasets and generated our own.

## Setup

```bash
# run the bash script within this directory, it will download all datasets and unzip them inplace.
bash setup.sh
```

> At least 15GB of space is expected for setting up all datasets.

The `setup.sh` sets up everything for you, including downloading and unzipping the files in correct location. 

`setup.sh` uses `wget` to download datasets from a raspberry pi server running at my home, so it might not be very stable. If it doesn't work, you can always use the cloud drive links below to download the datasets and `unzip` them manually.

After downloading the datasets, unzip them in such pattern in order to use them for training and testing.
