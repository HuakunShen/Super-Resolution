## Prerequisites

Use [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) to install all dependencies. (for anaconda)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The pytorch version we are using is **1.7.0** with cuda **11.0**. If you are not using the same cuda driver, please make sure you install the correct version for your OS.

## Dataset
We used 2 Datasets generated by ourselves by augmenting some other existing datasets.

## Contents

- [Trainer Framework](./SR): A trainer framework to make training a tracking easier
- [Models](./SR/model): All models are here
- [Experiments Results](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AFA6I61NVeysBP8&id=7A78FD2CB5D891D5%21161697&cid=7A78FD2CB5D891D5): All experiments results with model weights (more than 30GB in total)

## How to Train

Since we have many models and different parameters for training, instead of using a command line tool, we believe it's clearer to just use a python script for training.

All training can be done within [SR](./SR). Use the template training file [train_template.py](./SR/train_template.py) for training. More instructions on how it works can be found here [SR Instructions](./SR/README.md).


## How to Test

We prepared some scripts for testing. Testing requires you to download weight files from our experiment results. See [Contents](#contents)

See [how-to-test.md](./how-to-test.md) for more instructions.

## Visualizer

We made a Visualizer Web App for single image Super Resolution.
